# Configs

Reusable configs to standardise/share across Guardian codebases:

-   [.editorconfig](.editorconfig)
-   [@guardian/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/eslint-config)
-   [@guardian/prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/prettier)

## Note

This repo is primarily the source code to build the shareable configs listed above, rather than an example of them.

The one exception to that is the `.editorconfig`, because you can't publish those...
