# Configs

Reusable configs to standardise/share across Guardian codebases:

- [.editorconfig](.editorconfig)
- [@guardian/browserslist-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/browserslist-config)

## Moved packages

The following packages used to live here but have now moved to https://github.com/guardian/csnx:

- [@guardian/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/eslint-config)
- [@guardian/eslint-config-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/eslint-config-typescript)
- [@guardian/prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/prettier)

## Note

This repo is primarily the source code to build the shareable configs listed above, rather than an example of them.

The one exception to that is the `.editorconfig`, because you can't publish those...
